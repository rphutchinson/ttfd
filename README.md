Command line utility to measure __TTFD__ (Time to First Delivery) for a project using RTC/Jazz. 

As awesome as this is, sadly, it doesn't really work for even moderately active projects since the lscm (RTC) command line utility that this relies on will only return the most recent 100 change sets per component.
